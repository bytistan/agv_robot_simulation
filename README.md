# Robot 2D Simulation

This project provides a simple 2D robot simulation using Python. 
The simulation allows the robot to move in a given environment and perform various tasks.

## How to Use

1. First, clone the project to your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ulysses-o/hamal-simulation.git
    ```

2. Go to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hamal-simulation
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the following command to start the simulation:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Features

- Visualization of the robot's position and movement in real time.
- A simple path-finding algorithm for the robot to move towards the goal.
- Collision detection and avoidance with user-defined obstacles.
